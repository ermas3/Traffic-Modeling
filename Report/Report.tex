\title{Simulation of multi-lane highway using cellular automata}

\section*{Model}
The rules for the cellular automata were performed in two different parts at each time steps.
First lane changes were performed and then velocity changes were performed. Each rule was implemented for every car before
moving on to the next rule. The order of the rules matter, as latter rules can 'overrule' previous decisions.
